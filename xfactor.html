            <p>Little Mix were the first group and only girl group to win the British version of The X Factor. Arguably one of the X Factor’s biggest success stories, Little Mix are now an internationally-famous girl band. </p>

            <p>The four girls were put together on the show during the audition process and went on to be the first band to win the competition, beating Marcus Collins. They’ve released six studio albums to date which have all peaked inside the top 10, with hit singles including Salute, Black Magic and Shout Out To My Ex. </p>
